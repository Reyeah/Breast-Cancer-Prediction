The repository is a learning exercise to:

1. Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset.

2. Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set

## Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.



## DataSet

[The Breast Cancer Prediction (Wisconsin)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
